Founded in 2012, we dug tools for us to take closer care of our own feelings, time, space, actions, things, people, thoughts, and money.

Learn from yesterday, and we can plan better options, to short our troubles today.

The world can be wonderful for everyone, depending on how we look at each other.

A hug, a memento, a letter, or even 50 quids of fungible matter.

A compliment, an act of kindness, a smile of joy, is always multiplied when lived together.
