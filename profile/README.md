ðŸª™ DreamPip is fintech for compassion.

We long our dreams into happiness, arching closer our hopes and profits.

Founded in 2012, we dug tools for us to take closer care of our own feelings, time, space, thoughts, people, things, and money.

Learning from our yesterdays, we can all plan options, to invest our troubles away.

The world can be wonderful for everyone, depending on how we look at each other.

A hug, a memento, a letter, or even 50 quids of fungible matter.

A compliment, an act of kindness, a smile of joy, is always multiplied when lived together.
