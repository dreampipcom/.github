DreamPip is fintech for compassion. We enhance the experience of investing and financing collectively, connecting communities worldwide in financial arrangements that thrive with a sole focus on happiness, through healthy competition.

Our organizational structure is proprietary and is called Nexus Tree. DreamPip has a domain of Presence, where we take care of our brand, run a radio station, promote events, and establish an independent audiovisual streaming platform dedicated to the communities we engage with. Established between America and Europe since 2012, DreamPip (previously known as Remometro, Purizu, Karuna Collective, Bahouse, Letâ€™s Hero, and Tacitera) had over 800 listeners on the radio in August 2022, with a total of over 200 hours of listening distributed among Italy, the United States, Brazil, and other countries with a smaller audience.

In our resume, we have already carried out over 400 online radio broadcasts directly from the United Kingdom, Italy, Brazil, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, France, Finland, Estonia, and Sweden, with the participation of artists from countries such as the Netherlands, Russia, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Argentina, Portugal, Chile, the United States, Mexico, Japan, and Denmark, at least in 20 cultural events produced in Europe and Latin America, including a 4-day festival at the current OHM, located at Tresor, Europeâ€™s largest electronic music club. Throughout these experiences, we have always made sure to connect them with our main motif, which is compassion, having had the opportunity to help projects like My Mind My Funk by Sitawa Wafula in Nairobi, Kenya, United Religions Initiative, and many other communities such as those in SÃ£o Caetano and Bairro da Paz in Salvador, Brazil.
