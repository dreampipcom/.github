ðŸª™ DreamPip is fintech for compassion.

We long our dreams into happiness, arching closer our hopes and profits. 

To do so, we offer you tools to take closer care of your feelings, time, space, thoughts, people, things, and money.

We learn from our yesterday, then we draft plans, to invest our troubles away.

We believe the world can be wonderful for everyone, depending on how we look at each other.

A hug, a memento, a letter, or even 50 quids of fungible matter.

A compliment, an act of kindness, a smile of joy, shared together.
